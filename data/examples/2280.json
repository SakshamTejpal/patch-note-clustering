With the meaning of the name lost to time, it wasn't long before the interlopers began calling the land by another: \"New Eden\". Just like the Garden of old, mankind's exile from this newly settled realm was swift and brutal.\n\nThis remote region of Hell, overflowing in (un-)natural resources as it were, was almost entirely devoid of demonic presence. The Union Aerospace Corporation, never one to shy away from hubris and excess, learned the hard way that even the demons feared something greater, something deeper. When the Ones Beneath awoke, the UAC's crown jewel was swallowed in a cascade of blood and fire.\n\nThree hours -- all it took to reduce New Eden to a sea of molten glass.\n\nThree minutes -- all it took before the UAC's top brass played their ace.\n\nThree seconds -- all it took for you to weigh the risks before accepting the job.\n\nYour orders are clear: reclaim the lost base and preserve the UAC's Legacy.\n\nOr die trying.\n[hr][/hr]\nid Vault\nDive into the id Vault and explore concept art from DOOM + DOOM II\u2019s development, early versions of monsters, weapons, items, props, FX, HUD + Menus and textures left on the cutting room floor.\n[hr][/hr]\nEnhanced Cooperative Gameplay\nNew rules have been added to improve cooperative mode. If all players die, you will lose, and the level will restart. Respawn teammates by clearing all enemies in the area or finding a safe place to hide. Teammates will spawn near you, letting you get back into the fight quickly\n[hr][/hr]\nSplit-Screen Multiplayer\nDOOM + DOOM II includes 4-player split-screen multiplayer on all platforms, with 8 player split-screen available on Xbox Series X|S and PC. Fight against your friends in Deathmatch or with your friends in Cooperative mode, available in seven campaigns\n[hr][/hr]\nOnline Multiplayer\nFrag with friends and strangers alike across 43 different Deathmatch levels or play any of the episodes in co-op. Play alone or play online with local split screen players. LAN play is also supported.\n[hr][/hr]\nCrossPlay Multiplayer\nPlay with friends no matter which platform they prefer.

A spaceship, mistaken for a supply vessel, was granted access. But when it got close to the base, demons poured out. All your comrades were slaughtered or zombified.

Baphomet, the gatekeeper of Hell, \u201cglitched the final teleporter with his hidden sigil, whose eldritch power brings you to even darker shores of Hell. You fight through this stygian pocket of evil to confront the ultimate harbingers of Satan, then finally return to become Earth\u2019s savior.\u201d\nhttps://images.mweb.bethesda.net/_images/id1-1.png?f=jpg&h=1200&w=2130&s=jiBgG0pO7LurY4T1rLiV3U78kQxn9-UR7mYoKTpkxwQ\nLegacy of Rust\nCreated in collaboration with individuals from id Software, Nightdive Studios, and MachineGames, Legacy of Rust is the newest episode for DOOM, and the first official episode since DOOM II to feature new demons and weapons.

How do I access the new release?\nPrevious owners of DOOM or DOOM II on Steam will automatically receive the new version with a free update. It may already be updated by the time you read this!\n\nHow do I access the original versions of the game?\nSteam users can use the Beta Participation property option to download and launch the original versions, or the last version that we launched in 2019 labeled \"previous-re-release\"\n\nWhat are the supported resolutions and framerates on Steam?\nPC: Maximum supported by video card/display\n\nWhat input devices are supported?\nController, keyboard, and mouse are supported on all platforms, including consoles. Split screen is available with mixed mouse/keyboard and controller\n\nDo I need an always online connection to play the game?\nDOOM + DOOM II only requires an online connection to play online multiplayer game modes.

Rather than write out the differences between Final DOOM, Ultimate DOOM and just DOOM, we\u2019re consolidating our Steam library of titles! For those id Software experts that do know all the variations of our games released on Steam, bear with us as we simplify how our games appear so that newcomers have an easier time.\n\nHERE\u2019S THE PLAN:\nStarting August 10, we will begin rolling out changes to our Steam Store listings for select id Software games. In short, we are consolidating each game under one major title and/or changing the title for a simpler shopping experience.\n\nBelow will detail our current plans for Steam consolidation and how it affects your current Steam library if you\u2019ve purchased these games already. And don\u2019t worry, even if we are delisting a title you currently own, you\u2019ll still have the game in your library to download and play like always.\n\nWithout further ado, the lowdown:\n\nDOOM (1993)\nWe will be changing the name of Ultimate DOOM in the Steam Store to DOOM (1993). No other major changes are being made at this time.\n\nDOOM II\nDOOM II will include Final DOOM and Master Levels as one install package. Each can be launched separately as follows:\n\n DOOM II\n DOOM II (Enhanced)\n Master Levels for DOOM II\n Final DOOM\n\nDOOM 3\nDOOM 3 will be merged into a package containing the original DOOM 3 plus the Resurrection of Evil expansion and DOOM 3: BFG Edition. The package allows each version to be installed separately as follows:\n\n DOOM 3\n DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil (Requires DOOM 3 to be installed)\n DOOM 3: BFG Edition\n\nNOTE: Players that already own DOOM 3 or DOOM 3: BFG Edition on Steam will be upgraded to the DOOM 3 consolidated package with all three releases for free!\n\nQuake II\nQuake II and its mission packs, The Reckoning and Ground Zero, will be merged into one install package with multiple launch options:\n\n Quake II\n The Reckoning\n Ground Zero\n\nQuake III Arena\nQuake III Arena and Quake III Team Arena will be merged into one package with separate installs:\n\n Quake III Arena\n Quake III Team Arena\n\nSTEAM BUNDLES\nIn addition to updating our id Software titles on Steam, we\u2019re also revamping our bundles (as well as introducing some new ones!) Note that if you already own certain titles listed in each bundle, you can complete it to get the remaining games added to your library at a discounted price. See below for details:\n\nDOOM Classic Bundle\nReplaces the DOOM Classic Complete Bundle on Steam, with this bundle now including DOOM 3 and DOOM 64.\n\n Includes DOOM (1993), DOOM II, DOOM 3 and DOOM 64\n\nDOOM Franchise Bundle\nExplore more DOOM with this bundle, including both the classic DOOM games as well as DOOM (2016) and DOOM Eternal.\n\n Includes DOOM Eternal Deluxe Edition, DOOM (2016), DOOM (1993), DOOM II, DOOM 3 and DOOM 64\n\nQuake Collection Bundle\nDive into Quake, all in one convenient bundle!\n\n Package will include Quake, Quake II, Quake III Arena, Quake Live, Quake 4\n\nDELISTED TITLES\nThe following will no longer appear in Steam Store searches, but will remain in your installed library listings:\n\n Quake II Demo\n Quake III Arena Demo\n Quake III Team Arena Demo\n Quake III Team Arena (This will be included with Quake III Arena)\n Final DOOM (This will install with DOOM II)\n Master Levels for DOOM II (This will install with DOOM II)\n Quake II Mission Pack: The Reckoning (This will be added to the Quake II launcher.)\n Quake II Mission Pack: Ground Zero (This will be added to the Quake II launcher.)\n DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil (This will install with DOOM 3.)\n DOOM 3: BFG Edition (This will install with DOOM 3.

      "content": "Note for existing users\n\nThe unmodified, original DOS version running under DOSBox is still available! When launching the game, select \"Launch DOS version\" and you will have access to the previous version.\n\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/6aCAJjlPGQZW5nkioiiiSJ/07f1ab4d61e81aeb9824d722fb0204dd/New-Additions-Header.png\n\nAdded Steam Support\n\nAnyone who already owns either The Ultimate DOOM or DOOM II: Hell On Earth on Steam will automatically receive the new re-releases in their libraries. The original DOS versions are still available as a separate launch option from within Steam, and the original DOS IWAD files are in their original location on disk. Please note: if you have modified the files in the Steam install folder directly, some files may be overwritten. You should not modify files in the Steam folder directly, as this may cause issues. Anyone who purchases Steam copies of DOOM or DOOM II: Hell On Earth in the future; it will default to the re-releases but can access the original DOS versions as a separate launch option from within Steam.\n\nAdded widescreen rendering support\n\nFor the first time in an official port, the original DOOM renderer has been modified to natively render 16:9 without any letterboxing. The FOV has been increased to reveal more image on the side instead of chopping off the top and bottom. All new 16:9 versions of the titlescreen, intermission, and ending screens have been added. Many of our Add-Ons have also had widescreen support added, so download the latest version from the Add-Ons listing to check it out!\n\nDeHackEd support\n\nThe engine now can load DeHackEd patches, a popular tool for the original release that modified the game in order to support more advanced behavior. Add-Ons can now use new weapons, change enemy behavior, and more!\n\nDeathmatch 3.0 in split-screen multiplayer\n\nSplit screen deathmatch has been changed to what is commonly known in the community as \"Deathmatch 3.0.\" Weapons will stay in the world after being picked up in order to account for the extreme lethality of DOOM's weapons, and the weakness of the starting pistol, while all items and ammo respawn on a 30 second timer. Invulnerability and Invisibility will never respawn after being picked up for the first time.\n\nAdded optional crosshair\n\nA crosshair, which can be disabled in Gameplay Options, will also change colors when targeting an enemy. This means less guessing if firing a rocket is going to aim at the enemy above you, or fire directly into your face, bringing about an untimely death. Enabling the crosshair may also help reduce motion sickness by giving you a fixed point to focus on.\n\nAdded Gyro Aim\n\nGyro Aim, enabled by default when a DualShock 4 controller is plugged in, allows you to look left and right by either turning the controller, or rolling the controller left or right. This allows for an additional amount of precision by enabling fine corrections to turning in order to track moving enemies, while still using the right analog stick for large turning movements. Gyro Aim can be set to either use the controller's yaw, or pitch, or disabled entirely, along with a separate sensitivity slider.\n\nAdded FPS Limiter\n\nYou can set the FPS limiter inside Video Options to 30, 60, 120, 144, 165, 240, and unlimited FPS.\n\nAdded millisecond accurate timer\n\nA millisecond accurate timer has been added to the minimap, and to the end of level intermission, for anyone looking to speedrun levels.\n\nKeyboard entry of cheat codes\n\niddqd, idkfa, idclip, and all of their friends can now be entered from the keyboard, in addition to the Cheats menu, as in the original 1993 release.\n\nAdded secret area notification\n\nA message and notification is now displayed when you enter into a secret area for the first time.\n\nAdded Ultra-Violence+ Skill Level\n\nUltra-Violence+ is a twist on our existing Ultra-Violence skill level. Deathmatch/Co-op only weapons will spawn in, and enemies are fast like in Nightmare mode. In DOOM II, this means you get the BFG and Rocket Launcher right from the start, but in Final DOOM: Plutonia you'll have a Spider Mastermind staring you down as soon as you spawn in on the first level. It cuts both ways.\n\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/70TdEr4tsWFJvjjhpAaa2Y/2a5ff033c40b313e959612d0dd5f082d/Fixes-Header.png\n\n\nNightmare behavior has been fully restored to the original 1993 release by making enemies move twice as fast.\nIn honor of double speed enemies returning, the warning when selecting Nightmare difficulty has been restored.\nResolved an issue where lighting in split screen was not accurate compared to single player.\nImproved behavior of additional lighting option to increase light levels more accurately across walls and floors.\nPC/Switch: Reduced input latency by disabling rendering extra frames in advance.\nReduced delay in starting certain MIDI music in Add-On levels.\nResolved an issue from the original 1993 release where the Super Shotgun blast will linger for an extra frame.\nResolved an issue from the original 1993 release where the Former Human would not light up when firing.\nResolved a rendering issue from the original 1993 release where certain textures wouldn't tile vertically, commonly known as the \"Tutti-Frutti Effect\n\n\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/5OvFBxvTPaSYfzZcxTryeC/35689afd50ccbf880e61987746b4ed9f/CHANGES_header.png\n\n\nRestored original attract loop to the original 1993 release. The original title screen and credits screen are now visible between demo playback.\nRestored cut message from the original 1993 release when picking up a medkit, while having with less than 25 health.\nRestored cut \"ouch face\" from the original 1993 release for when a lot of damage is taken in a single hit.\nIntermission screen is now shown after boss levels, instead of cutting immediately to the ending screens in order to see level completion stats and time. Par times have been added to E1M8, E2M8, and E3M8.\nRandom SFX pitch is now disabled for chainsaw sounds to allow for better looping. Random pitch variation has been reduced for other sounds.\nPickup sounds and player voices will no longer interrupt weapon firing sounds.\nPS4/XB1/PC: VSync option in Video Settings to minimize input latency, at the cost of potential screen tearing.\nAdd-Ons will now use their intended custom graphics during intermission and level loading screens.\nLatest Add-Ons appear on the top of the Downloaded list."

      "content": "I didn   t think it was possible for Doom to get any better, but mods make everything better. The absurdly violent Brutal Doom mod is doing a great job of keeping Doom just as shocking and visceral of an experience as it was when it first came out 20 years ago, and the newest version will add ragdoll physics   because when I shotgun an Imp, I wanna see it tumble.\n\nThe Brutal Doom mod, which you may have seen us squee about before, adds new effects, animations, way too much blood, and other things that heighten the experience. v20, as you can see in the video above, makes each shotgun blast even more satisfying by knocking the enemy back an unreasonable distance. To me it looks like the right amount of ridiculous, but creator Sergeant_Mark_IV said he   s going to tone it down a notch.\n\n   I have been playing a lot of Killing Floor lately and noticed how small zeds are sent rolling on the floor when killed by shotguns at close range, I love this effect, then I thought about making something similar on Brutal Doom,    he said.    Of course it will not send almost every enemy flying away like in the video. I will reduce the minimum range from 300 to 200 units. I mean, the shotgun will only send flying enemies that are VERY close to the player, and shooting on the legs or heads still causes amputations.   \n\nWhen it comes out, v20 should also make the mod run smoother, make blood splatters and ejected magazine last longer, and other nifty things. It seems like Facebook is the best place to keep up with it, and you can download it for free from Moddb."

      "content": "Doom's just not metal enough; thank goodness for\u00a0Brutal Doom. Released in March last year, the beloved mod sought to make the classic even more hardcore and\u00a0real\u2014it introduced new death animations, gave objects shadows, and made headshots a thing. Now Brutal Doom's announced its 19th update, and after watching this trailer, I can say that I am very ready for this. (Though my ears, maybe less so.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrutal Doom's ModDB page reveals that the update releases August 9, with various unspecified new features, fixes, and \"polishments\" to be added. Developer Sgt Mark IV says that this will \"probably\" be the final version of Brutal Doom. The next game he's keen to focus on uber-gorifying with the Brutal treatment? Hexen. For now, we just wait till August for this. Someone pass me the super-chunky salsa\u2014I want to bite down hard on that tasty, tasty desensitization."

      "content": "In the word of Dethklok frontman Nathan Explosion: \"Brutal.\" Originally released in March, the Brutal Doom mod furnishes Doom's buckets of blood, steaming guts, and ultra-violence with a critically missing element: more buckets of blood, steaming guts, and ultra-violence. We're talking extreme Chunky Salsa Rule here. A freshly spawned Halloween update provides custom fatality animations as you RIP AND TEAR into Hell's minions. \n\n\n\nHelmed by the one-man efforts of Sergeant Mark IV, Brutal Doom doesn't just coat everything in strawberry juice. The mod also augments weapon and projectile behavior to react slightly more realistically\u2014slightly; you're still fighting demonic hellspawn in a box in space\u2014such as inflicting harmful splash damage to yourself if you're too close to a wall. Stealth kills and movable barrels are also possible. Headshots count. Limbs sever. \n\n\n\n\"Everything in Brutal Doom is extremely intense,\" the good Sergeant writes. \"Everything sounds louder, looks bigger, moves faster, and hits harder. The camera shakes every time something explodes near you. Enemies are harder and smarter, and weapons and explosions are loud as fuck.\n\n\n\n\"Some enemies will scream in anguish and try to crawl away when near death, and they can be used as human shields. Blood will drip through your visor every time you shoot enemies too close.\"\n\n\n\nBrutal."
