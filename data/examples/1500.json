      "content": "This update contains significant fixes and enhancements since the 2.3.2 release.\n\nMajor changes:\n\n The Vulkan renderer now requires a minimum of Vulkan 1.1. If your driver does not support Vulkan 1.1, it will try to use other renderers available on your platform.\n Fixed a crash on NVIDIA GPUs when running on recent graphics driver versions. NVIDIA's driver is one of the few to actually implement VK_SWAPCHAIN_CREATE_DEFERRED_MEMORY_ALLOCATION_BIT_EXT, and it interferes with older Vulkan layers (Steam overlay, MangoHUD) that were not designed with that behavior in mind.\n Fixed a crash when handling unexpected keyboard inputs.\n Fixed a very long-standing bug (probably since the original Darwinia release!) around world time handling. In a simplified explanation, the world expects to update at 100Hz, but it was actually updating at 90Hz. This caused numerous graphical glitches and strange behavior such as rubber-banding effects.\n Fixed crash when loading shape files with incorrect triangle counts (e.g. from mods).\n AntHills are now more dangerous. They were incorrectly not updating their objectives, so ants would repeatedly go back and forth between the same locations instead of changing targets to attack or pick up spirits.\n Implemented support for SMAA S2x (MSAA 2x + SMAA).\n Save games for mods are now stored in mod-specific subdirectories. This prevents accidentally loading a save game which does not match the loaded mod. Additionally, it is now possible to have multiple user profiles on a per-mod basis. Unfortunately, existing mod save folders must be moved to the new location by hand. For example, if your mod save game is currently named \"users/ModName\", you should move it to \"modusers/ModName/ModName\".\n Numerous performance and memory usage improvements across the board.\n\nMinor changes:\n\n Game controller detection was not behaving properly, causing the game controller help tips interface to flicker frequently.\n Fixed a minor UI glitch on the Steam Deck in the \"Reset Location\" dialog.\n Reduced Virii entity memory usage by half.\n Flag icons are now much higher resolution.\n Improved startup time on Windows by disabling some SDL features we didn't need.\n Shape explosions now preserve entity velocity.\n Updated contributing libraries.\n\nCompatibility:\n\n Improved compatibility of the ANGLE Direct3D 11 renderer with older graphics chipsets that support less than FL11_1.\n Now supports Mesa's GL-on-12 and Dozen (Vulkan on D3D12) renderers, if installed.\n Improved handling of DXVK for ANGLE D3D11.\n Fixed wildly incorrect rendering on the Haswell-based 2014 Intel Mac Mini.\n\nKnown issues:\n\n macOS: On MacBook Pro 14\"/16\" with 120Hz displays (or in fact any Mac with > 60Hz displays) there is stuttering in full screen mode.

(e.g. on Temple, the Spam cubes could be assigned the wrong team and be attacked by the red Darwinians)\n Now supports a new NVIDIA driver feature, the DXGI present path for Vulkan/OpenGL. Should greatly improve frame smoothness and eliminate stutters.\n Reduced stutter caused by one-off long frames.\n Reworked some of the water avoidance behavior. There were some bugs in how the water avoidance decisions were made, which caused Darwinians to sometimes become confused and just stand still after leaving water.\n When Darwinians or Squads are in water, instead of dying immediately after 10 consecutive seconds, they start to take damage over time.\n Fixed a bug where Darwinians would clip through the landscape when coming out of water, and then suddenly pop up above ground after several seconds.\n Fixed the floating-on-water animation to update every frame instead of every game tick.\n Worked around a bug in NVIDIA drivers older than 530, which caused some rendering glitches with VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library.\n Fixed some cases where AMD FSR 1.0 shaders would not compile correctly when targeting AMD GPUs.\n\nMinor changes:\n\n Introduced timed expiration for cached pipelines and shaders.\n Fixed a failure to initialize OpenGL core renderer on Zink.\n Fixed a bug in the mouse cursor render using 16-bit float RGBA framebuffers.\n Fixed targeting reticles being shown for units behind the camera.\n Minimized clipping of game cursor below the landscape.\n Fixed input handling bugs when running at very low framerates.\n Many code cleanups to modernize the code base a bit.\n Tuned thread priorities for audio and worker threads.\n Improved performance of MiniAudio mixing.\n Several minor performance improvements.\n Updated contributing libraries (MoltenVK, ANGLE, SDL, MiniAudio, etc)\n\nKnown issues:\n\n macOS: On MacBook Pro 14\"/16\" with 120Hz displays (or in fact any Mac with > 60Hz displays) there is stuttering in full screen mode.

      "content": "This update contains fixes and enhancements since the 2.3.0-25 release.\n\nMajor changes:\n\n Armour will now try to avoid collisions with buildings, and will not allow deploying gun turrets too close to other buildings.\n Gun turrets were incorrectly accounting for Darwinians, which caused only two of the four ports to be required to operate them.\n Some mods do not specify any lights in their level files, which causes the landscape and shapes to render as empty black space. We now specify a default lighting configuration if no lights are defined in the level file. This should make such levels at least playable, but they may not appear as the mod developer intended.\n Greatly improved game controller experience, now using much different thumbstick and trigger axis scaling methods. This was tested with an Xbox Elite controller, but it should improve the experience on any controller, including the Steam Deck.\n Mods with custom shapes, textures, and sounds should no longer require restarting the game to load correctly.\n Improved sound spatialization accuracy while the camera is moving, and improved sound playback performance.\n Partially worked around stuttering on macOS with high refresh rate displays. It's recommended to use the \"Automatic\" Resolution setting in Screen preferences for this workaround to take effect. Some stuttering may still be observed, see the \"Known Issues\" section below for details.\n Fixed major lighting render bugs on the Metal renderer.\n Many Screen preferences can now be applied without a full renderer restart.\n\nMinor changes:\n\n The in-game screenshot functionality performance has been improved.\n Reduced GPU memory for shape vertex data.\n Dramatically improved performance of \"Full\" Pixel Effect render for grenade/rocket explosions.\n Reduced the sort of jerky animation appearance for falling snow and Receiver spirits.\n Fixed glitched tree render and sounds when Christmas mode is enabled.\n Made falling snow fade out gradually when close to the ground.\n Fixed a localization bug in the intro cutscene for the Escort map.\n Fixed a bug where players could accidentally select units while trying to aim a radar dish or turret.\n Triffid eggs now respect SpawnPopulationLocks if present.\n Fixed some significant first-frame latency in the loader intros.\n Fixed shader pre-compilation missing some shader combinations.\n Fixed a bug with the level editor UI, which caused the increase/decrease buttons to operate on a delay instead of responding instantly and then *repeating* on a delay.\n Fixed several level editor render bugs when switching tool modes.\n Fixed some cases where Virii death animations would glitch in a strange way, especially if killed by rocket or grenade shockwaves.\n Fixed water occluding enemies that traveled out below water level (e.g. spiders or virii).\n Fixed solar panels glitching on rotate in the level editor (they're not supposed to be able to rotate).\n Fixed a bug with radar dish rotation, where rotating laterally in one direction was always faster than rotating in the other.\n Fixed some Darwinian shadow rendering behavior.\n Fixed some minor glitches in the gun turret render, causing them to appear to twitch when idle.\n User profile names can no longer be completely blank and crash the game.\n The sound system now avoids doing resampling when possible, conserving CPU utilization.\n Several level editor bugs around StaticShape buildings have been fixed.\n Shape hit tests were incorrectly accounting for scaling, causing mouse clicks to incorrectly miss some shapes in the level editor.\n Improved shader compilation speed, and improved caching robustness.\n Improved Vulkan frame pacing mechanism, to ensure lower latency rendering.\n Updated contributing libraries (MoltenVK, ANGLE, SDL, MiniAudio, etc)\n\nKnown issues:\n\n macOS: On MacBook Pro 14\"/16\" with 120Hz displays (or in fact any Mac with > 60Hz displays) there is stuttering in full screen mode.

      "content": "There have been several changes since the previous release, v2.2.0-296.\n\nMajor changes:\n\n Vulkan/Metal: Multi-sampling Antialiasing (MSAA) performance is dramatically improved on some systems. When supported, we now use Multisampled Render To Texture (MSRTT) instead of a render followed by an explicit blit to resolve. This benefits tile-based rendering GPUs especially (e.g. Apple M1/M2, etc), since Vulkan and Metal can both use very fast temporary \u201cmemoryless\u201d textures for the multisampled color and depth buffers.\n Vulkan/Metal: Apple GPUs can now use lossless compression for textures and framebuffers, which dramatically reduces memory bandwidth and improves performance.\n Vulkan: AMD GPUs can now use lossless compression for textures and framebuffers (DCC, or \u201cDelta Color Compression\u201d), which improves performance.\n Vulkan/Metal/Direct3D: On systems with multiple distinct GPUs (e.g. laptops with integrated graphics + discrete GPU, or with external GPUs), you can now select which device you want to render on in the Screen preferences.\n Vulkan/Metal: Fixed some awful-looking incorrect shading results around the edges of primitives affected by lighting. There seems to be either a shader compiler or hardware bug causing this, but we have worked around the problem by setting a [[sample_mask]] output in the Metal shader (even when multisampling is off). Unfortunately, this same bug is still present in Apple's built-in OpenGL-on-Metal implementation, and a workaround is impossible there since we have no influence on the generated Metal Shading Language code. It's strongly recommended to only use the Vulkan/Metal renderers on macOS.\n OpenGL: Fixed a bug where glTexStorage* calls were incorrectly being used on OpenGL 3.3-compatible systems which did not have the GL_ARB_texture_storage extension.\n Direct3D: Enabled support for DirectComposition, to allow using the D3D \"Flip\" model.\n SMAA/FXAA: Fix sampler bugs on some systems, which resulted in a completely black screen when either of these antialiasing methods were enabled.\n Sound: Fixed some significant channel mapping bugs if using fewer channels than the device supports (e.g. 2-channel on 7.1-channel hardware)\n Renderer: Shaders are now pre-compiled on startup, which should eliminate a lot of random frame hitches.\n Renderer: Textures are now pre-loaded on startup, which may eliminate frame hitches when previously unused textures are required.\n Renderer: Implemented caching for shader binaries and render pipelines.\n Renderer: Worked around a long-standing Windows AMD Vulkan graphics driver bug that caused the game to crash whenever alt-tabbing out of full screen mode.\n Renderer: Borderless Fullscreen mode now respects the resolution preference, and scales the image to fit the desktop resolution.\n Renderer: Reduced memory usage for several textures that internally require only one or two color channels.\n Windows: The FPS overlay (Shift+F5) in the top left now can display system and GPU memory utilized by the game.\n Windows: Fixes for filesystem unicode path handling on Windows versions older than Windows 10 build 17134. \n macOS: Improved performance on Apple Silicon.\n Windows: Improved audio latency.\n Camera: Fixed some FOV bugs with cutscenes.\n Camera: Fixed some movement bugs when skipping cutscenes.\n Darwinian: FIxed some bugs with Darwinians not detecting nearby enemies quickly enough.\n Darwinian: Now will recognize certain building types as enemies and flee from them.\n Spiders: Made spiders look less ridiculous when landing after a jump.\n Gun Turret: Now will recognize certain building types as enemies and attack them.\n Fixed broken savegame behavior for Launchpad (the Prologue game map).\n Modified automatic UI scaling to better handle ultrawide aspect ratios (e.g. 21:9).\n Fixed another bug where Spiders might stetch in weird ways to attempt to attack Air Strike units.\n Greatly improved performance of the sphere world's \"Internet\" render.\n Sound system performance is much better and more consistent.\n Updated game controller database.\n Updated contributing libraries (MoltenVK, ANGLE, SDL, etc).\n\n\nKnown issues:\n\n macOS: On MacBook Pro 14\"/16\" with 120Hz displays (or in fact any Mac with > 60Hz displays) there is stuttering in full screen mode.

This is because the AMD graphics driver enables the VK_EXT_full_screen_exclusive extension implicitly, and ANGLE doesn't know how to handle it. This can be worked around by either using Fullscreen Borderless in Screen options, or by using a different Renderer backend (OpenGL Core, Direct3D 11)."

      "content": "Fully re-mastered in 2022 to celebrate the Darwinian's 10000 anniversary this updated version brings an undisputed indie classic bang up to date.  Running seamlessly on all modern systems, the game hasn't aged a day and is a fresh and relevant now as it was when it first dropped.  Winning 3 out of 5 prizes at the IGF including the Seamous McNally Grand prize for Best Independent Video Game and multiple editors' choice awards, now is the time to play one of the most critically acclaimed indie games of all time.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe entire graphics engine has been rewritten from scratch for compatibility with modern graphics APIs and better performance. Darwinia is currently compatible with systems with support for OpenGL 3.3 core, Direct3D 11, Metal, or Vulkan. Support for non-OpenGL graphics APIs is made possible by ANGLE.\n\nOther high-level changes include:\n\n- All the in-game UI now scales more appropriately with the size and DPI of the monitor it's running on\n- Support for anti-aliasing modes including MSAA, SSAA, SMAA, and FXAA\n- Support for AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1.0 (FSR)\n- Support for anisotropic texture filtering\n- Higher fidelity colors and tonemapping\n\nSound\n\nThe sound engine now supports up to 7.1-channel surround sound and uses 3D spatialization (i.e. directional audio and doppler effect), using MiniAudio. The sound engine supports any of the backends that MiniAudio does, including but not limited to WASAPI (Windows), PulseAudio (Linux), and CoreAudio (macOS).\n\nCompatibility\n\nDarwinia now requires hardware and drivers that support a minimum of at least one of these graphics APIs:\n\n- OpenGL 3.3\n- Vulkan 1.1\n- Direct3D 11\n- Metal\n\nOn Intel and AMD CPUs, the minimum instruction set requirement has been raised to SSE4.2, for higher performance 3D graphics math (matrices and vectors). \n\nApple Silicon Support on macOS\nmacOS builds now have support for both Intel and Apple Silicon.\n\n\nSteam integration\n\nThe Steam release has a few minor features integrated for a better experience on the Steam platform, including:\n\n - Cloud saves and Dynamic Cloud Sync support\n - On-screen keyboard support (e.g. on devices using game controllers in Big Picture mode, or the Steam Deck)\n - Tuned default settings for better Steam Deck support\n\nPerformance\n\nOutside of architecture-specific changes, numerous performance improvements have been made throughout the entire game engine. One nice side effect of the heavy emphasis on performance is that Darwinia now requires far less energy to run, increasing battery life and playtime on laptops and other portable devices like the Steam Deck.\n\nBugfixes\n\nThere have been many bugfixes on numerous axes, including scripting, level editing, input handling, graphics, sound, stability, and game AI."
