Thanks to your feedback from the menu flow of Accessibility options we introduced in Update 4, we've improved the initial flow. On first startup, you will be presented with the following screen and have to choose one of the two options:\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/1cjUc2OaBRvb221wV3s7NU/5ed3b2a439c30a99e7f71e254f29ffa7/Quake_Update4.1_Initial_Accessibility_Screen_960x540.png\nChoosing Disable all settings will disable all Accessibility options and return you to the main menu. Choosing Customize accessibility settings\u2026 will bring you into the Accessibility Menu to so you can access the full list of settings.\nWe hope this helps players who were confused in Update 4 by the high-contrast and alternate typeface options being enabled, but weren\u2019t sure how to disable them, while allowing players looking to dive into our Accessibility options quicker access.\n[hr][/hr]\nOTHER MINOR UPDATES\nLevel Select Menu\n\n Restored missing level MGEND: Chthon's Vengeance to the Level Select menu\n\nAdd-ons Menu\n\n Add-ons menu selection images are now 16:9 aspect ratio\n\nThreewave CTF\n\n Restored Threewave CTF spawns to original intended system: players will spawn for the first time in their own base, but afterwards will spawn randomly at deathmatch spawn points. This will prevent players from spawncamping a team inside their base\n\n[hr][/hr]\nICYMI - Read the full release notes from our last major release: Update 4 here."

      "content": "Update 4 for Quake includes the return of the legendary progenitor of team-based multiplayer: Threewave Capture the Flag! We have resurrected nine iconic levels from the original mod just in time for QuakeCon to bring you and seven of your closest frag friends back together again!\n[hr][/hr]\nTHREEWAVE CAPTURE THE FLAG (CTF)\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/4iyRQZMzjY47QUqxHCiQZQ/3c0671d58577052b19ae5755956d3764/Quake_ctf.gameplay.png\nThe rules for Capture the Flag are similar to the backyard game: protect your flag, steal the enemy\u2019s, and return it to your own flag to score a point. Threewave CTF comes with some extras to this basic formula by adding power-up runes for teams to fight over, and the famous grappling hook!\n[hr][/hr]\nA BRIEF HISTORY\nFor all those scholarly Rangers out there, here's a brief history...\nThreewave CTF was first released in October of 1996 by Zoid Kirsch. The mod back then was simple, and remixed existing game content to create something new. Matches took place on the single player levels modified to create bases. Keys were used in place of flags, and the grappling hook was an axe that fired a Vore ball. While a little bit of imagination was required, this didn\u2019t hurt the mod\u2019s reception at all. It caught on fire immediately and built a large fanbase of players looking for a deeper alternative to deathmatch.\nOver the course of many updates, and eventually a QuakeWorld version, Threewave CTF would go on make Capture the Flag a household name in multiplayer game modes, and even spawn websites that exclusively covered Capture the Flag modes in games. Threewave CTF would be released officially as a part of Quake II, and the Quake III version of the mod would bring in new flag-based game modes and maps that would later make their way into Quake Live. Quake multiplayer and Threewave CTF have always been intertwined, and now the mod that started it all is now available for free in the enhanced Quake re-release\n[hr][/hr]\nNEW ENHANCEMENTS\nThis latest version of Quake has been enhanced, with an improved flag status display showing if your flag is safely in base, team scoring, and a modern interface. The maps included have been updated with improved lighting and fog effects. All of this is included free in Update 4, and requires no additional download\n[hr][/hr]\nRUNES\nFour power-up runes spawn randomly throughout the map at the start of the match. Teams will vie for control over them, as they bestow their holders great benefits, and will stay with them until death. They fly out of the player on death, so keep an eye out, and grab them as quickly as possible to posses their power. If nobody picks them up eventually, they'll respawn elsewhere. Holding these runes are key to giving your team the edge to win!\n[hr][/hr]\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/TXq9i0oRBlVG5jzP4Ax1w/edc76b844c872feef284ab4187490b24/Quake_Rune_Earth.Magic_960x540.png\nRune of Earth Magic | Resistance - Take half damage from all weapons\n[hr][/hr]\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/3ItYZNa3p4OX5Pqs3FaouZ/a962d2c81a4a8d1a7c663176a05accd8/Quake_Rune_Black.Magic_960x540.png\nRune of Black Magic | Strength - All weapons deal double damage\n[hr][/hr]\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/1hJfBLmolPQJVUlGJ7BkQn/2468176354ec3038d63a9809130a6e54/Quake_Rune_Hell.Magic_960x540.png\nRune of Hell Magic | Haste- Most weapons fire twice as fast, and nail projectile speed doubles\n[hr][/hr]\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/1Uy37Nfc1yw77suc4UQn9H/63429546db77f06a4c35d94e8e67dfa4/Quake_Rune_Elder.Magic_960x540.png\nRune of Elder Magic | Regeneration - Regenerate some lost health and armor every second, up to 150\n[hr][/hr]\nGRAPPLING HOOK\nThe grappling hook, accessed via the weapon wheel or by pressing the key bound to the Axe, is more utility than weapon than most options in your armory. Holding down the fire button will shoot the hook, where it will fly straight forward until it hits a wall. Once attached, the hook will pull you in at a very high speed. The hook can be attached to players to do a constant stream of damage; however this will leave you vulnerable to the player you are attached to.\nSwitching weapons while the hook is attached will allow you to hang off walls and fire, however you will be vulnerable as you will be unable to move, doing your best impression of a turret. Using this to ambush an attacker can be an effective tactic, however it should be used sparingly as ambushes only work if they are unexpected!\nAdvanced players can shoot the hook at the ground, and then immediately let go as soon as the hook starts to pull you. This lets you launch into a bunny hop at a very high speed, and makes you less predictable of a target as you weave your way around the map\n[hr][/hr]\nMAPS\nOur update includes nine of the maps from the original mod\nhttps://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/hVH0BRfmtin2OLRVI6fDu/ecc567a42f8e532f70966b12dbf4bbba/ctf1.png\nCTF1: MCKINLEY BASE\nCreated by Zoid Kirsch\nTwo bases connected by bridges, and an underwater route.

      "content": "A new update for the venerable FPS game Quake has added some welcome new accessibility features to the user interface, 26 years after the original version launched for MS-DOS. When you fire up the Steam version of Quake after applying today's patch, you'll notice that the main menu is displayed in a bright white, sans serif font - and there are other new options available as well.\nThe latest Quake patch adds additional accessibility options to Quake's main menu. When you first run the game after applying the patch, that will be the first screen that pops up, giving you the chance to select which of the new features you want enabled. You'll find new options for high contrast menus, the alternate menu typeface, and text-to-speech and speech-to-text options for chat.\nFor players with auditory or visual processing difficulties, these options could make playing the granddaddy of deathmatch significantly easier. In-game messages can be prominently displayed in crisp white lettering over black background blocks, making it much easier to see text like \"you got 5 shells\" or \"you found a secret area.\"\nRead the rest of the story...\nRELATED LINKS:\n\nQuake just got a new horde mode, made by the Wolfenstein devs\n\nQuake 1 gets a \"major update\" that takes aim at mod problems\n\nWhat if: Quake gets a Doom Eternal style reboot?"

To accommodate this feedback, we\u2019ve made Horde Mode less difficult on Easy and more difficult on the Hard and Nightmare skill levels. We hope these balance changes are to your liking and look forward look forward to hearing from you on them!\n\n Fewer enemies are spawned in each squad on Easy skill selection\n Boss enemies will start showing up in earlier waves on Hard and Nightmare skill selections\n Hard skill selection now starts with as many enemies as wave 3 had previously\n Nightmare skill selection now starts with as many enemies as wave 6 had previously\n Additional balance adjustments:\n Ammo now respawns every 20 seconds instead of once per round\n Enemies are now more tenacious \u2013 they will now route around the map and obstacles to find you. No more hiding and safely picking off harmless monsters from a distance!\n Four player games will now spawn in double the enemies in each wave\n\nMultiplayer\n\n Removed ability to enable cheats in public multiplayer matches (Note: Cheats can still be enabled from a PC host in private matches)\n Changed color of enemy text chat from red to green for increased contrast and improved legibility\n Online multiplayer text chat messages can now be sent via the Pause Menu (Note: Only PC versions support text entry from physical keyboards)\n Added option to toggle the scoreboard on/off with a button press instead of a button hold (in Gameplay Options)\n\nMultiplayer Bots\n\n Added Deathmatch bot support for all single player levels in the original campaign, courtesy of Jorge Martins (Check out their super useful guides made for community modders here)\n Bots now roam around if the current map doesn't have items, finding their own roam goals\n Bots now better handle maps with lots of air blasts that push them around\n Improved bot navigation on MGDM1, and E1M2\n Bots now roam around if map doesn't have items, finding their own roam goals\n Bots now better handle maps with lots of air blasts that push them around\n Improved bot navigation on MGDM1, and E1M2\n\n[hr][/hr]\nBUG FIXES\nGeneral Gameplay\n\n Fixed an issue in which music was not playing correctly on certain Add-ons\n Reduced audio latency throughout the game\n Fixed a bug in which the House of Doom achievement was not unlocking when finding the secret level in Dimension of the Past\n Resolved an issue in which the Corner message would print the incorrect one for a single frame\n Fixed an issue in which menus would not scroll all the way to the top of the screen\n Resolved the issue where the text chat window was too small while playing at 4K resolution on supported platforms\n\nHorde Mode\n\n Fixed a bug in which suicide in Horde Mode would not deduct points and immediately respawn you\n Resolved an issue in which killing a teammate would incorrectly grant a frag and not end kill streaks\n Removed the random offset from dropped powerups to prevent them from falling out of the level\n\nMultiplayer Bots\n\n Fixed an issue in which bots would sometimes miss shootable triggers\n Fix bots incorrectly using Mjolnir when they don\u2019t have ammo\n Addresses the issue where bots wouldn\u2019t chatter when killing an enemy, or if teamkilled\n\n[hr][/hr]\nMODDING IMPROVEMENTS FOR MODDERS\nThe following changes apply to users who may be developing Add-ons that work on the PC version of Quake\n\nGeneral Modding Improvements\n\n Our QuakeC source code is now available! This includes the QuakeC source for the base game, Scourge of Armagon, Dissolution of Eternity, and the new Dimension of the Machine, which includes Horde Mode. This code is released under the GPL license and can be obtained from the id Software GitHub here\n QuakeC built-ins that are unique to the rerelease are now looked up by name, rather than hardcoded builtin numbers which could interfere with other engines\n Fixed issue with long centerprints disconnecting clients when sent, which could occur when using long custom intermission end texts in Copper\n Added \"walkpathtogoal\" QuakeC built-in. This can be used as a drop-in replacement for the existing AI movement to allow any entity to take advantage of bot pathfinding without needing them to be a bot client. Create a friendly dog that does your bidding, or haunted items that run away from the player to avoid being picked up. The world is your oyster!\n New entities are available for ranged, flying, and boss spawn points. The horde spawning logic will use these points if available\n Monster spawners can be controlled by using trigger_multitouch entities to enable or disable them as the player moves throughout the map\n\nMultiplayer Bots\n\n Added \"bot_movetopoint\" - new QuakeC built-in to give bots a high level command to move to a point\n Added \"bot_followentity\" - new QuakeC built-in to give bots a high level command to follow any entity that they are aware of\n Added Bot_PreThink - new QuakeC function that gets called before bots run their update logic in the engine\n Added Bot_PostThink - new QuakeC function that's called after bots run their update logic in the engine\n Added \"objective\" flag to items.txt processing. This allows you to tag any item as an objective. Bots track these as a special case, but rely on you to tell them what to do about it\n Warn at startup if weapons are not correctly setup with a power of two number in QuakeC\n Add cvar \"bot_entityRespawnFunc\" to tell the bots which function in a QuakeC mod handles respawning items. Bots use this knowledge to understand when items like the MegaHealth will actually respawn\n Bots can receive and will react to two stuffcmds: \u201ccolor\u201d and \u201ckill\u201d\n Update monster teams regularly - allows mods to add/remove monsters from teams during the game, and have bots understand the change\n Support idea that monsters can \"belong\" to a player in DM\n\nBot Navigation Editor\n\n Add cvar \"navEdit_removeNoclipOnExit\" to disable turning off noclip when exiting nav editor\n Expose bot pathfinding heuristic value to users in the nav editor, and save the heuristic into the nav file\n Rename cvar navEdit_waterLookPointDist to navEdit_inWaterLookPointDist for clarity\n When underwater, place nav node centered on crosshair\n Fix nav node placement in shallow water\n Add ability to clear start/goal nodes when testing paths in the editor by pressing F8\n Add ability to toggle seeing traversals when testing paths in the editor by pressing F5\n Add \"NoMonsters\" flag to nav nodes. Allows you to mark nodes that AI shouldn't use (eg. if the node is too close to a wall or obstacle that might get an AI stuck, but are not issues for bots)"

It also features numerous mod support improvements to get new and old Quake mods working with the new remaster.\nThe new enhanced edition of the first game in the Quake series was announced at QuakeCon in August and released the same day, along with two original expansions created by Wolfenstein: The New Order developer MachineGames and a PC version of Quake 64. It was great news - especially as it was released as a free patch for anyone who owned Quake on Steam.\nHowever, despite being a remaster of a 25-year-old game, the enhanced edition didn't launch without issues. Players reported numerous issues, including control problems such as with gamepads, mods not being compatible with the new version, multiplayer not working correctly, choppy performance - especially on the new expansion, Dimension of the Machine.\nRead the rest of the story...\nRELATED LINKS:\n\nWhat if: Quake gets a Doom Eternal style reboot?\n\nQuake remastered is real, out now, and brings Quake 64 to PC\n\nIt looks like a Quake announcement is coming soon"

Additionally, if you didn't own Scourge of Armagon and Dissolution of Eternity on Steam, you will also be granted access to the original versions of those in-game\n\nHow do I access the original versions of the game on Steam?\nSteam: Launch options are available to launch the original versions of the games, and the original files are still on disk in the same place\n\nHow do I play with friends on other platforms via cross-play?\nThe easiest way to join a cross-play match with friends is using the room code system. The room code is a 4 letter code that can be seen inside the pre-game lobby. Send this to your friends over text message, Discord, or yelling very loudly, and they'll be able to join through the multiplayer menu without having to search through the match browser or enter passwords. Note that on some platforms, cross-play can be disabled at the system level. If you have problems joining cross-play matches, ensure that this is enabled\n\nIf I already own Quake on Steam, will my saves carry over?\nExisting save games do not carry over from the original to the enhanced versions of Quake and Steam and Bethesda Launcher. You can continue to use original Quake save games by launching the original version of the game on both platforms\n\nWill I need a Bethesda.net account to play the game?\nA Bethesda.net account is required for online multiplayer, and Add-ons. Everything else in the game is playable without linking your account\n\nWhat are the resolutions and framerates for PC?\nPC: Maximum supported by video card/display\n\nWhat input devices are supported on PC?\nOn the PC, mouse and keyboard and most controllers should work. Split-screen is available with mixed mouse/keyboard and controller\n\nDo I need an always online connection to play the game?\nQuake can be played offline. Currently, official Add-ons require an internet connection to play even if previously downloaded, however we hope to address this in a future update\n\nAre existing mods supported on PC?\nThe PC enhanced version will load any mod that the original version supported (when existing mods have been placed in the game install directory). However it will not support some mods that require a new/different source port from the original game\n\nNote: We did raise some engine limits from the original version in our new enhanced version but cannot confirm compatibility with all modern Quake mods\n\nCould Not Join Lobby' error on when trying to join Multiplayer?\nThis error occurs on all platforms when you're system clock is out of sync. Please consult you system manual for how to re-sync your system clock. \n[hr][/hr]\nKNOWN ISSUES\n\n In local multiplayer, the weapon wheel will be partially cut off in vertical split screen. This does not occur in horizontal split screen\n If the player uses the Attack input to respawn in multiplayer, they will fire a shot as they respawn\n Users are unable to access downloaded Add-ons without being connected to the internet. This is not intended functionality and will be fixed in a future update\n While in local multiplayer, if you wish to remove players from the lobby, you need to back out of the local multiplayer menu and re-enter it\n Some player movement issues may occur in online co-op matches in Scourge of Armagon\n The Guardian death sounds in may repeat indefinitely in Scourge of Armagon.
